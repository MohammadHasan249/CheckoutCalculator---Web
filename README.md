# CheckoutCalculator---Web

I had an assignment for my university course - Introduction to Software Engineering - where we had to design a checkout system, with multiple hard-coded items, and a cart, etc.

This assignment had two components: a Web app, and an Android app. The Android app can be found in another repository!

NOTE: Only 4 voucher codes work for the discount - "HELLOPROFS&TAS", "PLSGIVEUS100PERCENT", "SMILEYFACE", "HAVEANICEDAY" :)

Happy pretend-shopping!
